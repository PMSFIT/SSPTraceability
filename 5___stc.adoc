== SSP Traceability Common

This chapter describes in detail the content and structure of the XML schema stc.xsd. The elements defined by the schema represent common concepts for ensuring traceability that are reused in many places of other XML schemes for the topic of simulation process traceability. The purpose of the extraction of these reused elements is to increase the flexibility and extensibility of the GlueParticles approach and to help to apply the GlueParticles concept to other topics in product and system engineering.

[#sec-derivationchain]
==== DerivationChain

#The SSP Traceability data formats DTMD and STMD are primarily intended for the standardized exchange of information packages between tools and partners. They do not have built-in versioning mechanisms. The SSP Traceability package represents a snapshot of the used versions of the linked sources and resources. Versioning of sources and resources is done in the generating tools and data management systems.#
#The exception is the derivation chain. Each time an STMD or DTMD file is written, a new entry is created in the derivation chain with a unique identifier of the file from which the new instance is derived.
When a tool or data management system receives an SSP Traceability container with STDM, DTMD back, it can check, by comparing the derivation chain with the target system's data infrastructure, which version of the DTMD or STMD was sent. This serves as a basis for controlling the reintegration of received DTMD STMD and it can be determined what is already available, what has been modified, what is new, etc.).#

The DerivationChain element can be used to provide the appropriated set of information about files that were used to derive the current file. If the content of the current file can be considered to be derived from one or a set of other GlueParticle, then the top level meta data and DerivationChain information of those files should be included in their original order as entries in this file's DerivationChain element.

=== LifeCycleInformationType

The LifeCycleInformationType element defines the structure and attributes of life-cycle information about the enclosing phase or step element.

The LifeCycleInformationType element defines the structure and attributes of life-cycle information about the enclosing phase or step element.

[#im-lifecycleinformationtypeschema]
.LifeCycleInformationType element structure and attributes
image::LifeCycleInformationTypeSchema.png[]

The following life-cycle states are intended for use. In the following explanations, the term "information to which life-cycle status applies" always refers to a **complete** phase with all of its steps, or to a **complete** step within a phase. Life-cycle information **never** refers to more than one phase and **never** refers to more than one step within a phase. 

* **Drafted:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies represents a draft status and is still in progress. This can also mean that the information is not complete and is still being finalized.

* **Defined:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies is considered complete and may be subject to review or validation.

* **Validated:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies has been reviewed and validated.

* **Approved:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies has been approved based on review and validation.

* **Archived:** The information to which the life-cycle state applies has been set as valid and remains valid for this instance of the GlueParticle, but may not be reused for similar steps or phases in other GlueParticles (reuse is not allowed).

* **Retracted:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies has been withdrawn and is considered invalid or may need to be revised.

Due to the inherent dependencies of life-cycles, life-cycle information in later phases will depend to some extent on the life-cycle status of earlier phases: For example, if the Implementation phase is marked as having reached Validated status, there would be a contradiction if the Requirements phase had only reached Drafted status. Multiple life-cycle information entries may exist to record the historical progression of the life-cycle status, but only the last entry in the document order, which will also be the most recent, is considered valid for the current file contents; earlier states only record historical data.

Recommended value entries are #__'document', 'requirement', 'specification', 'model', 'parameter', 'system', 'testcase', 'result', 'method', 'rationale', 'report', 'request', 'delivery', 'executable', 'configuration'__#. The meaning of the values are described directly below this table.  If no more precise label applies, the kind __'document'__ can be used.
| scope          | Optional            | This attribute indicates the scope or level that a resource is specific to, i.e. whether the resource applies at a global, system, subsystem or component level.  The use of this attribute is optional, i.e. it should only be specified where it makes sense to give this kind of information.
| type           | Mandatory           | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional            | This attribute indicates the source of the resource as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the GlueParticle.  Therefore for resources that are located alongside the GlueParticle, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the component sources.  For resources that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this GlueParticle, this is mandatory (in this way, the GlueParticle URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the file system). If the source attribute is missing, the resource is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise.
| master         | Optional            | This attribute, if present, indicates the original, canonical master source for the resource. If it is present, it indicates that the content provided via source attribute and/or Content element is only a copy of the original, canonical data, and this attributes provides the URI reference to that original canonical master data.
| id             | Optional            | This attribute gives the model element a file-wide unique id which can be referenced from other elements or via URI fragment identifier. 
| description    | Optional            | This attribute gives a human readable longer description of the model element, which can be shown to the user where appropriate.

__'rationale'__:: #A resource of kind __'method'__ should contain information about why a related process step is or was performed in the way it was performed. This is especially true for activities that were not performed in the specified way for good reasons, or where assumptions and simplifications were made.#

__'report'__:: #A resource of kind  __'report'__ should provide information about the requested results in a human-readable report format, i.e., aggregated and condensed to a level that directly relates to the requestor's question or the goals and intent of the simulation.#

__'request'__:: #A resource of kind __'request'__ should contain information provided by the "requester" to perform the task. The requestor here is synonymous with the parent process or requesting organizational unit.#

__'delivery'__:: #A resource of kind __'delivery'__ should contain information that provides the "client" with information about the execution of the task and the result of the task.#

[#sec-summary]
==== Summary

The Summary element provides an optional summary of the resource being referenced. The summary information is intended for human consumption to get an overview of the resource content without looking at the content itself.  The summary content can be provided inline through the Content element, or it can be provided through the source URI attribute.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Attribute name | Optional / Mandatory | Attribute description
| type           | Mandatory            | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource summary, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.  If markdown content is used, then the type text/markdown shall be used. 
| source         | Optional             | This attribute indicates the source of the resource summary as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the GlueParticle, if the sourceBase attribute is not specified or is specified as GlueParticle, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of summary sources that reside  inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For summaries that are located alongside the GlueParticle, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the summary sources.  For summaries that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this GlueParticle, this is mandatory (in this way, the GlueParticle URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the filesystem). If the source attribute is missing, the summary is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be resent otherwise. 
| sourceBase     | Optional             | Defines the base the source URI is resolved against: If the attribute is missing or is specified as GlueParticle, the source is resolved against the URI of the GlueParticle, if the attribute is specified as resource the URI is resolved against the (resolved) URI of the resource source.

| type           | Mandatory           | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource meta data, which does not have a default value. If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional            | This attribute indicates the source of the resource meta data as a URI (cf. RFC 3986). For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the GlueParticle, if the sourceBase attribute is ot specified or is specified as GlueParticle, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of meta data sources that reside inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For meta data that are located alongside the GlueParticle, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the meta data sources.  For meta data that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this GlueParticle, this is mandatory (in this way, the GlueParticle URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the file system). If the source attribute is missing, the meta data is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise. 
| sourceBase     | Optional            | Defines the base the source URI is resolved against:  If the attribute is missing or is specified as GlueParticle, the source is resolved against the URI of the GlueParticle, if the attribute is specified as resource the URI is resolved against the (resolved) URI of the resource source.

It indicates whether the digital signature is intended to just convey the authenticity of the information, or whether a claim for suitability of the information for certain purposes is made.  In the latter case, the digital signature format should include detailed information about what suitability claims are being made.
| type           | Mandatory           | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource signature, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional            | This attribute indicates the source of the resource signature as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the GlueParticle, if the sourceBase attribute is not specified or is specified as GlueParticle, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource.
